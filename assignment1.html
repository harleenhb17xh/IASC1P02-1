<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> From the beginning, First Nations people were never perceived as actual people by the European settlers. </p>
<p> The European settlers completely undermined Indigenous people whilst entering Canada for the first time, they did not acknowledge the first inhabitants of Canada as real persons, let alone as anyone of significance to their new claimed society. </p>
<p> The European settlers viewed Indigenous people as baggage to their society, as if indigenous people were holding the settlers back from developing Canadian new economic structure. </p>
<p> Thus, Indigenous people were not able to involve themselves in the labor market due to, lack of education and beneficial skills, dehumanization and discrimination, and lack of help from the Canadian government to establish their own business developments. </p>
<p> The first method that the European setters used in order for the First Nations people to be involved and integrated into their society was with the act of assimilation.</p>
<p> The European settlers truly believed that the only way in which Indigenous people could be of use to them, was to strip them of all of their culture and religion, in an attempt to transform First Nations people into who the settlers.</p>
<p> Thus, the establishment of residential schools were created. These institutions provided no useful education or beneficial skills to the Indigenous children, in order for them to actually be successful in the future. </p>
<p> <em> For boys, little literacy training was provided, and most activities focused on menial agricultural activities and chores for the school.</em> </p>

<p> Essentially, the only beneficial skill the Indigenous children were taught was agriculture, but this is not exceptionally helpful due to the fact that, Indigenous people may be perceived as useful in society only when agricultural workers are needed.</p>
<p>The European settlers did not perceive First Nations people as real people.</p>
<p>They did not acknowledge how Indigenous people are the first inhabitants of the country they utterly claimed for themselves, this idea is evident as Frideres states, they were not defined as real persons. </p>
<p>First Nations people were discriminated against by the settlers in every way possible. </p>
<p>The European settlers continued to view them as invaluable and incapable of work contributing to Canadian society, but they failed to register how Indigenous people were successful in their ways of life and how to take care of themselves and their communities long before the settlers arrived. </p>
<p> <strong> Indigenous people were never granted the opportunity to show the settlers that they were capable of work, as they were prior to the settlers arrival. </strong> </p>

 <ol> The schools were:
  <li> unsanitary </li>
  <li> dehumaninzing </li>
  <li> claustrophobic </li>
  </ol>

<ul> The students felt:
  <li> alone </li>
  <li> violated </li>
  <li> upset </li>
</ul>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

<p> As a final point, it is unconceivable that the setters not only stripped Indigenous people of all their culture and religion, but also did not provide them with an ounce of beneficial education and skills.</p>
<p> The continouation of dehumanization and discrimination, and lack of aid from the Canadian government to act on the one skill they were granted the opportunity to learn and establish their own business developments on, all contribute to their absence in the labor market. </p>
